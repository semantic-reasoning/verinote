"""State for the test-environment sandbox, shared by `conftest.py` and its tests.

This lives in its own module rather than in `conftest.py` on purpose: pytest
imports a conftest as the top-level module `conftest`, so a test doing
`from tests.conftest import ...` would create a *second* module object with its
own copy of the state. Both the conftest and the tests import this module under
the same name, so there is exactly one.
